Today I took apart another MVC architecture
(Model View Controller).

This architecture is very easy to understand. There are 3 dependent components. 
1) Model - all the business logic of the application is stored.
2) View - application interface
3) Controller - User request handler via data model

This architecture is well suited for simple applications, one of them was consumed today (I even remember UIKit + Storyboard).
